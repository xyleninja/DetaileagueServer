## DetaileagueServer

The Backend of the Detaileague Client.

### Getting started

Since we use the RIOT API, we need a devKey.
Enter your devKey in a config.json with thekey "devKey".

We need also a MySql-Server.

config.json - Example

    "mysqlHost" : "localhost",
    "mysqlUser" : "root",
    "mysqlPassword" : "",
    "mysqlDatabase" : "detaileague"

Then run these commands...

Console: npm install

Console: node .

Runs on localhost:3000
